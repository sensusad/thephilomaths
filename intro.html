    <h1> Abstract <br>
      The study of Newari culture in the Kathmandu Valley offers a unique glimpse into the rich and diverse history of Nepal. The Newars, the indigenous inhabitants of the valley, have a long and storied tradition that has been shaped by their geographic location at the crossroads of trade routes and their position as both a dominant political and commercial force in the region.

This study will examine the various aspects of Newari culture, including its language, religion, art, architecture, and social and economic practices. By examining the ways in which these elements have evolved and interacted with each other over time, we can gain a better understanding of the cultural dynamics of the Kathmandu Valley and the role of the Newars in shaping its history.

In addition to providing an in-depth look at the cultural traditions of the Newars, this study will also explore the challenges and changes that the community has faced in recent years, including the impact of globalization and modernization on their way of life. Through a combination of field research and analysis of historical sources, this study will provide a comprehensive and nuanced portrait of Newari culture in the Kathmandu Valley.
